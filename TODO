This is a list of some of the things I plan to work on for future releases
of gFTP. If there is something you feel should be included in a future
version of gFTP, let us know.

* SITE command - give option to not specify SITE

* I need to be able to send an event from the core library to the presentation
  layer to have it ask the user a question. I need this for the SSL layer so 
  that if an unknown certificate authority signed the certificate, the user
  can be prompted whether or not to accept it. Also, it would be handy to 
  prompt the user for their password if a bad password was entered. 
* Support tabbed interface in GTK+ port
* Be able to save the state of the transfer queue. Be able to pause transfers.
* -d command line, check if it's a file first, if so download. If not, grab directory
* Playing sounds after certain events or calling external program
* Recursive directory compares
* Make it execute a program on a url (say rpm -qpi ftp://site.com/file.rpm)
* Add registered file extensions to options dialog
* Add support for SRP protocol (http://srp.stanford.edu/srp)
* Add support for DAV protocol
* Add support for rsync protocol
